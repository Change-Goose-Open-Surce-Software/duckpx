*<ins>What are the differents betwen Fast Install and Manuel Install ?</ins>*

Fast installation installs the already compressed file of Github, this is faster recommended for PC with low computing power and is also the stable version!  
Manual installation is recommended for PC with more computing power as it is better to perform the compression local which however needs a lot of computing power! This is also an untested, partly incomplete version that can throw errors and contains bugs.
